## For maintainers

### Checkout a PR branch from a fork

To check out a pull request branch from a fork, first install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

Then, from the repository, you can run, for example:

```bash
gh pr checkout 2
```

where the final number should be the PR number.

If you don't want to use the GitHub CLI, this can also be done using just regular git. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71787682).
